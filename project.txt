Recipe Finder App:

Integrate with a recipe API (e.g., Spoonacular API) to fetch recipes based on user input (e.g., ingredients or dish name).
Display recipes along with ingredients and instructions.
Allow users to filter recipes based on dietary restrictions or preferences.
Use conditional branching to handle cases where no recipes are found for the given input.
Utilize template literals for dynamically rendering recipe information.
